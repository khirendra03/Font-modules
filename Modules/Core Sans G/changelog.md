Description	The Core Sans G Family is a part of the Core Sans Series. 
               Core Sans G is constructed of straight, circular or square shapes. These geometric shapes are inspired by classic geometric sans (Futura, Avenir, Avant Garde etc.). Every stem is a rectangle or a straight line and every letter, lowercase or uppercase, seems to be in perfect geometric form and even weighted. 
               The small x-height makes readability clean and clear. Core Sans G can be used equally well in headings or in body copy. 
               The Core Sans G Family consists of 9 weights with matching Italics. It also includes four effects fonts (Outline, Neon, Shadow, Dimensional), alternate characters (a,g,t) and a plethora of ligatures. 
               Core Sans G provides a wide range of character sets to support (Cyrillic, Central and Eastern European characters) and advanced typographical support with features such as proportional Figures, tabular Figures, numerators, denominators, superscript, scientific Inferiors, subscript, fractions, standard ligatures, discretionary ligatures and stylistic alternates.
